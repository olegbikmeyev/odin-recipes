# odin-recipes
This project demonstrates general understanding of: 

-Creating very basic HTML tags
-Naming conventions of files as well as file management
-Basic usage of Git and Github
-Inserting images and embedding links to different pages of the project

It should also be noted that the project was done in strict accordance with the instructions described on TOP project page, for example, the author did't add boilerplate in three recipe pages. Although it might seem obvious, there were no clear instructions for doing so, so the author decided to stick with the instructions.
